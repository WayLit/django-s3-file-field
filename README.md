# joist

[![PyPI version shields.io](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/joist.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/joist/)

Joist is a Django Widget library for providing a direct S3 bucket upload via the browser instead of going through the server. It extends the [django-storages](https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages) library for the S3 file storage. It also supports [MinIO](https://min.io/) by extending the [django-minio-storage](https://github.com/py-pa/django-minio-storage) library. In case neither of the two storage providers are enabled joist will fall back to a regular file upload behavior.

## Installation

```sh
pip install joist
```

by source:

```sh
pip install -e 'git+https://github.com/danlamanna/joist.git#egg=joist'
```

## Configuration

### AWS

Joist depends on the django-storages S3 config (see https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html), following settings are used

| Key                     | Description  |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID       | Your Amazon Web Services access key, as a string. |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   | Your Amazon Web Services secret access key, as a string. |
| AWS_S3_REGION_NAME      | Name of the AWS S3 region to use (eg. eu-west-1) |
| AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME | Your Amazon Web Services storage bucket name, as a string. (required) |

Additional settings

| Key                     | Description  |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| JOIST_UPLOAD_STS_ARN    | The STS Arn Role to use (required) |
| JOIST_UPLOAD_DURATION   | The duration the upload token should be valid in seconds (default: `60*60*12 = 12h`) |
| JOIST_UPLOAD_PREFIX      | Prefix where files should be stored (default: `''`) |
| JOIST_API_BASE_URL | API prefix where the server urls are hosted (default: `/api/joist`) |

### MinIO Configuration

Joist depends on the django-minio-storage config (see https://django-minio-storage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/), following settings are used

| Key                     | Description  |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| MINIO_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY       | Your MinIO access key, as a string. |
| MINIO_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY   | Your MinIO secret access key, as a string. |
| MINIO_STORAGE_ENDPOINT      | The access URL for the service |
| MINIO_STORAGE_MEDIA_BUCKET_NAME | Your MinIO storage bucket name, as a string. (required) |


### Common

Additional settings

| Key                     | Description  |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| JOIST_STORAGE_PROVIDER  | The provider (aws, minio, unknown) that is used (default: derived from DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE setting) |
| JOIST_UPLOAD_DURATION   | The duration the upload token should be valid in seconds (default: `60*60*12 = 12h`) |
| JOIST_UPLOAD_PREFIX      | Prefix where files should be stored (default: `''`) |
| JOIST_API_BASE_URL | API prefix where the server urls are hosted (default: `/api/joist`) |

## Usage

### Setup

Add `joist` to the list of installed apps:

`settings.py`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    'joist',
]
```

Moreover, since the field requires additional REST endpoints one has to use add them to the `urlpatterns`:

`urls.py`
```python
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('api/joist/', include('joist.urls')),
]
```

### Model Definition:

instead of

```python
photo = models.FileField()
```

use
```python
from joist.models import S3FileField

photo = S3FileField()
```

The result is that once the user select a file in the file chooser, it will be automatically uploaded to S3 on the client side.

## Signals

Joist sends out two signals when its REST api is called:

```python
joist_upload_prepare(name: str, object_key: str)
joist_upload_finalize(name: str, object_key: str, status: string)
```

## Development Environment

### Requirements
 * Python 3.7
 * node
 * AWS CLI (AWS setup)
 * Terraform (AWS setup)
 * docker + docker-compose (MinIO docker setup)


### AWS
#### Init AWS
login to AWS Concole and create an API access key
```sh
aws configure
```

#### Run Terraform
```sh
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform workspace new <NAME>
terraform apply
```

#### Create env File
```sh
cd terraform
terraform output > ../example/.env
```
Note:
 * edit the `.env` file and remove the whitespaces around the `=` characters


### MinIO
#### Create env File

create a `example/.env` file and add these entries:
```
MINIO_STORAGE_MEDIA_BUCKET_NAME=test
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=rootAccessKey
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=secretWithAtLeast8Characters
MINIO_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=actuallAccessKey
MINIO_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY=secretWithAtLeast8Characters
```

#### init MinIO
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

check logs using `docker-compose logs` it should start up normally and it should have created the user and bucket automatically



### Init Django and Python Repo
```sh
pipenv install --skip-lock
pipenv shell
cd example
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Init Repo Pre Commits
